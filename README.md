**3. Summary:**
The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight.

The two questions are as follows:
1) How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?.
2) Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

The respective answers are as follows:
1. 90,398 roles will need to be filled as soon as possible, since the retirees will retire at any time. This is an urgent requirement.
2. No, there aren't enough qualified, retirment-ready employees in the department to mentor the next generation. We currently have 1,940 employees, well short of the needed requirement.
